### Tech

Hotels deals app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

# At server side NodeJS, Why NodeJs:
> As as server side, which is the destenation for many users, 
it must be speed, scalable.
> How NodeJs support the speeding and the scalability?
> By Asynchronous process, i.e it provides an event-driven  
> architecture and a nonblocking I/O API that optimizes an 
> application's throughput and scalability.

* [Backbone] - JS framework for web apps!
* [Marionette] - extended from backbone for web app.
* [jQuery] - to manipulate the html elements.
* [Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework.
* [Mocha] - Test a Node RESTful API.
* [Travis] - Travis CI to test build.


### What I've learnt from the app:
> As a programming side, I have already the experience to manipulate the data using the NodeJs language and to make it support us as we like, but its a good idea that makes the developer in a challenge to think how the criteria will match a different name of which its name at the storage, with a little cost, so the best performance.

> I've used query helper to translate the criteria keys to which it stored in our offers, also I've put the way of comparing between offers and criteria, I choosed this way in order to reduce the cost of the api.

> As a deploying side, it was the second time for me for deploying the site, I've learnt alot about this process, I think it was interesting.

> Testing using mocha and travis were interesting ways to check my apps.

> Being a full stack web developer, and at the same time being separately
at each side was interesting.
